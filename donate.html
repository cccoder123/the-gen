  <p>Feeling GENerous?! Send us your accounts! The requirements are:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>HyPixel preferred (it's ok if HyPixel banned, but we would prefer it if it wasn't banned)</li>
  <li>2FA on (We don't want the passwords to be changed, so others can use the gen)</li>
  <li>You must not change the password at some point, as we cannot restock it</li>
  <li>When giving us the alt details, you need to put it in this format: *username*:*email-that-you-registered-with-your-minecraft-account-(we recommend changing it to another email that you do not use):*password*</li>
    <li>An example is: batman:brucewayne@gmail.com:RobinBabs12</li>
